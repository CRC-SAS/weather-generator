# Weather Generator (GLM version)

## Installation
The *Weather Generator* is under active development and the only way to install it 
now is through the installation of the development version from GitHub. The easiest 
way to do this is via the `install_github()` function from package *devtools*. Make 
sure you have *devtools* installed, then run this command to install the package:

```r
devtools::install_github("CRC-SAS/weather-generator", ref = 'glmwgen')
```

Note that, depending on your OS, R packages that will be installed as dependencies 
of the *Weather Generator* may require the installation of additional OS packages.
Generally the installation process indicates which OS packages are required.
